<h1> Prediction Markets </h1>

<h2> About the Application : </h2>
<ul>
<li> Prediction Markets are an very interesting application in DeFi Space. This application is also motivated from it and I have tried to create a simple but elegant smart contract for betting for the US Elections.</li>
<li> Within the smart contract functions created are : createBet, reportResults, withdraw. Basically everyone will place their bets, then result would be announced and finally winners would be funded with their prize. </li>
<li> Advantages of such a system is that no middlemen is sitting to manipulate the results plus as promised winners would be instantly awarded with their money.</li>
<li> Unlike other centralised betting platforms where control is in the hands of an authority so if they decide not to pay the winners nothing can be done.</li>
<li> I created unit tests for testing smart contract functioning on local development space. </li>
